# FlaFlow research wishlist

Here's a roughly prioritized list of the kinds of research I'd love to automate with FF:

(what is the "deep research” capability" ?)

### People research

1. LinkedIn Recruiter search saved page
   - would a PDF download work as well as a full HTML page download?

1. CSV lists of candidate, partially filled out
   - Future Founder [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GHU7lIb8Ty7jMYYLSbOw8vHdq0FzGxqp_n61ArlYLAM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
   - would be nice if I could just provide a link to a google sheet

1. LinkedIn post - everyone mentioned, everyone who liked/reacted, everyone who commented
   - can just send a link or need to download the HTML?
   - e.g. MIT entrepreneurship contest [finalists](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mit-100k-entrepreneurship-competition_mit-100k-entrepreneurship-competition-activity-7322818669871300608-fxFi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAAI2EBBm5-5UmgY4ckMPzEh-e8N-7UNxc)

### Organizations

1. All companies mentioned in a PDF
   - daily tech newsletter from The Information
   - pages from our Notion technology ecosystem

### Papers

1. Arxiv / BioArxiv / Google Scholar Link to individual paper, like the [Goedel-Prover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07640) paper
   - start with arxiv links only if that’s easier

2. CSV list of research papers, partially filled out
   - [Bio research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o99HjaduCeh_WdWQ2MWZhBtoDFRB8E0q1z1jVhXz8HQ/edit?gid=1249854002#gid=1249854002) for Chai / Axiom / Achira


### Labs


### Events


### Entity Resolution Capabilities

- look up candidates via LinkedIn url in hireez to see if we can find more info (links, emails)
- add an extra “entity resolution” check — look at profile pictures
- enhance how we find more profile matches — using their handle/username
- try to find someone's last name if they only show their last initial on LinkedI (e.g. find them mentioned in the context of their lab or high school) and then do a web search
- try to find a github profile match via the user search within github (https://github.com/search?type=users&q=%s) rather than via google search
