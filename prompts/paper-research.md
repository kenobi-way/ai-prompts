I am attaching a PDF list of research papers, with links and summaries, related to [AI for protein folding & design].

For each paper, find the paper online, starting with popular preprint / archive sites like arxiv.org and www.biorxiv.org and aggregators like scholar.google.com or dblp.org. If the paper was published in a journal or at a conference, also look there. Also see if the paper has an associated github project and/or website homepage. Then, try to download the paper and synthesize the following information from the paper itself and any github, homepage or other links:

**Category:** A single descriptive category for this paper -- e.g. "Database Systems" or "AI for Molecular Design"

**Title:** Full title of the paper

**Venue:** Name of the journal or conference where this paper was published, or "preprint" or "blog" or "technical report" as appropriate if it is not a peer-reviewed publication.

**Citations:** How many citations the paper currently has, if known (e.g. according to google scholar).

**Published:** When this paper was published, in the form of "Month Year", e.g. "July 2025"

**Organizations:** Comma-separated list of the primary universities, companies, research institutes or other organizations involved in this research (where the authors are employed or otherwise conduct research).

**Labs:** Comma-separated list of the labs affiliated with all of the authors in this research, especially of the first author(s) and principal investigator(s). Each lab should be listed with parent university/company/organization in parenthesis, e.g. "FAIR (Meta)" OR "Leskovec Lab (Stanford)".

**About:** A 3-5 sentence summary of the objectives, findings, methods and notable innovations / impact / implications of the paper.

**Tags:** Comma-separated list of 1-5 tags that could be used to classify or categorize this paper, a more detailed list of classifications than the single Category. For instance, tags could include "Generative Models" OR "Protein Folding" OR "Database Query Optimization."

**Arxiv:** The arxiv.org URL for this paper, or equivalent archive site, if found. Only the raw URL, not formatted as a hyperlink

**Google Scholar:** The scholar.google.com.org URL for this paper, or equivalent aggregator site, if found. Only the raw URL, not formatted as a hyperlink

**Homepage:** The URL to the paper's homepage, if found. Only the raw URL, not formatted as a hyperlink

**GitHub:** The URL to the paper's github repo, if found. Only the raw URL, not formatted as a hyperlink

**First Authors:** Comma-separated list of the "first" or primary authors of this paper, with their affiliation in parentheses; e.g. "Nathan Boyd (MIT CSAIL)".

**Other Authors:** Comma-separated list of other (non-primary) authors of this paper, with their affiliation in parentheses; e.g. "Nathan Boyd (MIT CSAIL)".

Finally, create a CSV table ready to copy/download containing all of your research findings. DO THIS NOW FOR ALL OF THE PAPERS I HAVE PROVIDED. Do not ask me to confirm/verify the format or show me subsets of the research. I am only interested in seeing all of the results together at once. I have already gone over the format with you in other chats/sessions and am satisfied with it.
