# Guidance for conducting web research on companies and organizations

For each organization:

1. Try to find the org's primary, top-level Crunchbase page, such as https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rork. If you find a funding round page, find the link to the top-level page under "Organization Name”.

2. Try to find the company’s Pitchbook page, such as https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/756780-76.

3. Try to find the company's homepage, which will normally be listed on the Crunchbase and/or Pitchbook pages, such as https://rork.com/.

4. Try to find the company's LinkedIn homepage, such as https://www.linkedin.com/company/rork-app/.

5. If the company is build on/around open source technology, try to find the Github repo for their main technology, such as https://github.com/apache/spark for Databricks (Apache Spark).
